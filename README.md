# HedgeLib
A C# library [under the MIT license](https://github.com/Radfordhound/HedgeLib/blob/master/License.txt) that aims to make modding games in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise easier, similar to Dario's excellent "[LibGens](https://github.com/DarioSamo/libgens-sonicglvl)."

Right now it supports the following:

##Hedgehog Engine
- Reading lights.

##Generations/Unleashed
- Reading uncompressed archives.
- Reading set data.
